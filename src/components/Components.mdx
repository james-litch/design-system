# Components

The components in the design system are designed to be used across multiple projects. They are designed to be generic and not project specific. Complex layouts should be avoided where possible.

## Usage

To use a component, import it from the design system and use it in your project.

```jsx
import { Button } from '@scandotcom/design-system';
...
<Button>Click me</Button>
```

## Using the styles

If you wish to implement the components without React. You can view the markup of components in storybook by clicking the HTML tab at the bottom of the storybook preview.
This is handy if you are using a different framework or just want to see the markup.
