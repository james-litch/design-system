# Styling

Bellow are some best practices that are recommended when developing with the web.

## Be the browsers mentor not its micromanager

Pixel perfection is a thing of the past. Browsers are smart and can handle a lot of the heavy lifting for you. Let them do their job and you do yours.
Give the browser reccomendations and let it do the rest.

There are a collection of layouts the best show this off. Check out the [layouts](?path=/docs/layouts--docs) section for more information.

## Use CSS variables

CSS variables are a great way to keep your code DRY. They allow you to define a value once and use it in multiple places.
If you need to create a new style for a component make sure to use CSS variables for colors.
For more information on CSS variables, check out [MDN - CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).

## Components

Our design system provides styles for some of the basic components that you will need to create a website.
These components include buttons, inputs, and typography. 
For more information on components, check out the [components](?path=/docs/components--docs) section.

## Layouts 

Our design system provides a collection of common [responsive layouts](?path=/docs/layouts--docs) that dont need media queries. 

## Utility classes

We leverage [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) for utility classes. This allows us to create larger components quickly and easily, without having to name css.

## Recipes 

We have a collection of recipes that show how to create common components.
You can copy the markup and styles and use them in your project, by clicking the HTML tab in the addons section of the canvas e.g [FAQ recipe](?path=/story/recipes-disclosure--faq).
