# Getting Started

This is the documentation for the design system. It contains all the information you need to get started.

## Figma
 
[Scan.com Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/team/780605331611258662/all-projects?fuid=1177629003887292479) is a collaborative design and prototyping tool. It's the heart of the design process, allowing designers to work together seamlessly.

## Installation

To install the design system, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @scandotcom/design-system
```

Install any dependencies that are not already installed.

```bash
npm install react
```

## Usage

Within your projects main CSS file import the parts of the design system you wish to include, along with tailwindcss.
Optionally you can import the entire design system.

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';

@import '@scandotcom/design-system/styles/index.css';

# or
@import '@scandotcom/design-system/styles/button.css' layer(components);
....
@import '@scandotcom/design-system/styles/fonts.css' layer(base);

# css layers help to ensure that your project specific styles take precedence over the design system styles.
```
