# Accessibility

It is important to make sure that your website is accessible to all users.
This includes users with disabilities and users with slow internet connections.


## Semantic HTML

Use semantic HTML elements where possible. Semantic HTML elements include lists, appropriate headings form labels.
This will help screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the content of your website. 
For more information on semantic HTML, check out [MDN - HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML).

## ARIA attributes

Use ARIA attributes where semantic HTML is not available.
ARIA attributes can be used to add additional information to elements that are not available in the HTML spec e.g breadcrumbs and dropdowns.
For more information on ARIA attributes, check out [MDN - ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) and [WAI-ARIA patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/).


## Keyboard navigation

When creating custom components, make sure that they are accessible via the keyboard.
A handy site to check how various components should be navigated is [WAI-ARIA patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/).

## Alt text on images

Use alt text on images to describe the content of the image for users who can't see the image.
The alt text should describe the content of the image and NOT inlude "image of a", "picture of a" etc.

## Screen reader only text

Use screen reader only text to provide additional information to screen readers. This can be done using the `sr-only` class.

```html
<!-- some svg that isnt accessable -->
<svg aria-hidden >...</svg>
<span class="sr-only">This text wont be visible</span>
```

## Form labels 

Use form labels to describe the purpose of every form element.
Form labels should be associated with the form element using the `for` attribute or by wrapping the form element in a label element.
For more information on form labels, check out [MDN - Label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label).

## Headings

Use appropriate heading levels to describe the content of the page. There should be only 1 h1 element on the page and the rest should be h2-h6.
For more information on headings, check out [MDN - Headings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements).

## Navigation regions

Use navigation regions to describe the navigation of the page. This can be done using the `nav` element.
For more information on navigation regions, check out [MDN - nav](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav).

## Progressive enhancement

Use progressive enhancement to enhance the user experience of your website. 
This means that the website should have a minimum level of fuctionality without JavaScript.
For more information on progressive enhancement, check out [MDN - Progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement).

## Forms

Forms are the most accessible way to get user input. Want to update some page filters? Use a form with method="GET".
For more information on forms, check out [MDN - Forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms).

## SearchParams

We can also store state inside the URL using the SearchParams. 
This allows us to share the state of the page with others, e.g with pagination: 
```https://scan.com/news?page=2``` or with filters: ```https://scan.com/search?modality=mri&body_part=brain&body_part=bladder&next_day=on```.

For more information on SearchParams, check out [MDN - URLSearchParams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams#examples).
