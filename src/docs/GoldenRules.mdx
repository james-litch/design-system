# Golden Rules

In order to maintain consistency across projects and ensure that the design system is used correctly, we have a set of golden rules that should be followed.

## Do not add project specific styling.

Do not add any project specific styling and components.
This is designed to be a generic design system that can be used across multiple projects without lots of breaking chnages.

## Consult the design team before making changes to this design system.

If you need to make changes to the design system, please consult the design team first.
This is to ensure that the changes are in line with the design system and do not break any existing projects.

## Keep the design system up to date.

Make sure that the design system is up to date with the latest changes, this includes any new components, styles or icons.

## KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid.

Keep the design system simple and easy to use. Do not overcomplicate things, i.e adding complex components.
All styles should be atomic, e.g styles like input, button and checkbox should not style labels.

## Use the cascade

Use the cascade to your advantage. This means that you should not need to add lots of classes to style an element.
Write your markup first and then slowly add classes, you may find that some styles are already applied e.g [Typography - Defaults](?path=/docs/typography--docs#defaults) .
