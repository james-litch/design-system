# Switcher

The switcher layout switches from rows to columns, given a certain breakpoint. This is useful for switching between mobile and desktop layouts without media queries.


## Usage 

To use the switcher layout, simply add the `switcher` class to the parent element. CSS variables can be used to override the default values of the layout. For example, to change the `switcher` layout breakpoint, add the following:

```html
<div class="switcher">
```

### Optional CSS Vars

<Controls />


### Base 

<Canvas of={SwitcherStories.Base}>
    <Story />
</Canvas>


### Flex Grow

By adding a `grow-` Tailwind token to a child element, that child will 'grow' faster than the other children. This is useful for creating a layout where one child takes up more space than the others.

<Canvas of={SwitcherStories.Grow}>
    <Story />
</Canvas>

### Reverse Wrap 

By adding the class `flex-reverse-wrap` to the parent element, the children will wrap in reverse order.

<Canvas of={SwitcherStories.ReverseWrap}>
    <Story />
</Canvas>

### Multiple Children

This layout also works great with multiple children.

<Canvas of={SwitcherStories.Multiple}>
    <Story />
</Canvas>

### Spacing

By adding `gap-` , `gap-x` or `gap-y` Tailwind tokens to the parent element, you can control the spacing between the children.

<Canvas of={SwitcherStories.Gap}>
    <Story />
</Canvas>
