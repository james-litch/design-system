# Typography

We have 2 types of typography, fluid and normal. 

## Fluid

Fluid typography is a typography that scales with the viewport width. It is useful for creating responsive designs without the need for media queries.
To read more about fluid typography, check out [utopia](https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator?c=320,14,1.2,1280,16,1.333,5,2,768&s=0.75|0.5|0.25,1.5|2|3|4|6,s-l&g=s,l,xl,12).

```html
<div class='text-fl-0'>foo</div>
```

<Canvas of={FluidStories.All}>
    <Story />
</Canvas>


## Normal

Normal typography is a typography that does not scale with the viewport width. It is useful for creating fixed width designs.

```html
<div class='text-base'>foo</div>
```

<Canvas of={NormalStories.All}>
    <Story />
</Canvas>


## Defaults

Default typography styles are applied to all text elements.

### Headings

Heading levels 1-4 are bold(700) with a font family of `Maison Neue Extended`.

<Canvas of={HeadingStories.H1ToH3}>
    <Story />
</Canvas>

### Font Size

By default all text has a font size of `--font-size-fl-0` applied.
